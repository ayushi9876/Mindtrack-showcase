## üöÄ Project Overview

**MindTrack** is an innovative deep learning-based tool designed to assist educators and clinicians in the early detection of **dysgraphia** by analyzing handwriting samples through image processing techniques. Utilizing **MobileNetV2**, advanced image preprocessing, and transfer learning, MindTrack achieves accurate, efficient, and scalable predictions that can help identify writing difficulties at an early stage.
